# FEH_Auto-Battle_Farming
 Ahk script designed replicate FEH Pass's infinite auto-battle feature.

 This works by doing a simple image search, and loops back over itself when it hits the end of the search list.  
 
 To get this to work on your pc, you will have to download an emulator (I suggest Memu).  Other than that...
 The only requirement to run make the script work on your end will be to take screenshots of the buttons we want to press.
 You need to take your own, but you can find examples of what you need in the ButtonImages folder.
 This is because your monitor resolution will be different than mine, so my screenshots(.pngs) will likely not work for you. 
 Replace the images in the folder with your own, and name them accordingly.
